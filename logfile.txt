The idea is if they see each other in the mirror, then they will have implicit eye contact which will help faciliate social interaction.             Only leave if you think your presence will cause awkwardness. Attract before leaving.             These are the following actions:             (1) Attract to fidget your mirrors to attract the people's attention.             (2) Leave to leave             (3) Connect to move the mirrors such that the two people can see each other in the mirror.
